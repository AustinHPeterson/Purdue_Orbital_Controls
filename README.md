# Purdue Orbital Control System
The Purdue Orbital Control System is a real-time PID based feedback control system capable of orienting a rocket into optimal azimuth and altitude angles for launch.
The system is intended to be used with Purdue Orbital's very own Launch Orientation Control System or LOC System running aboard the launch platform on an Arduino microcontroller in combination with a pair of combined MegaMoto Motor Control Shields, one for each degree of freedom.
